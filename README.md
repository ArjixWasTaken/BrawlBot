A quick hack made for brawlhalla that plays Queen Nai (at the moment). It can be improved a lot more however I'm losing interest.

# install requirments
```
pip install https://github.com/hrt/memorpy/archive/master.zip
```

# usage
First adjust `calculate_actual_input` in `play.py` to match your ingame settings.


You'll probably need to update `g_input_offsets` and `local_ptr_offsets` in `offsets.py`
```
python play.py
```
